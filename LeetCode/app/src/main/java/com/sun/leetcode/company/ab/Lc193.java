     193. Valid Phone Numbers
     DescriptionHintsSubmissionsDiscussSolution
     Given a text file file.txt that contains list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

     You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

     You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

     Example:

     Assume that file.txt has the following content:

     987-123-4567
     123 456 7890
     (123) 456-7890
     Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:

     987-123-4567

     (123) 456-7890
